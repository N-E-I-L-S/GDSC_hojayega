referral - lets introduce a loyalty card for regular customer with basic discounts and perks like new exclusive dishes. our aim -- if they refer 1 or 2 friend for the loyalty card then maybe they get  a special discount which can be availed during less busy hours. 

keep events like coffee tasting where customers can try new varieties in addition to the old ones. here old ones will have the same price but the new ones can be at a minimal price. this can help in getting real time feedbacks and increased popularity. food bloggers/influencers can be the special invitees for the same. entry fees - null for card holders 

discounts on bulk offers (can be on college ids too) in non peak hours --  eg.
